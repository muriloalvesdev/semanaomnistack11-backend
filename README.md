## Motivation

This backend was created in nodejs and is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), as described in the Readme.md of the [frontend](https://github.com/muriloalvesdev/semanaomnistack11-frontend) of this application, as I have not yet mastered node, react and also react-native I decided to get down to it and learn in a practical way!

I currently work with Java and [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) and I feel weak knowledge in relation to other technologies, that is, "one language programmer". As I like to learn a lot I decided to get my hands dirty and start with practically nodejs, react and react-native. So I decided to participate in semanaomnistack with Rocketseat weekly mix and the result was this!

Thank you very much [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat)!
